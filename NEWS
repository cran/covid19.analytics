Jul 2020:  Several new features and bugs fixes _ ver 1.1.1
		- added new geographical categories to select data per continents, implemented via geographicalRegions() fn
		- added tests cases
		- geneate.SIR.model()/plt.SIR.model(): added plotting of time derivatives and "force of infection"
		- covid19.Toronto.data(): updated to handle new format of the data, 3 categories in columns
		- covid19.Toronto.data(): can return original data as reported by the city in google-docs in a list format
		- covid19.Toronto.data(): improved reading of Toronto data to protect possible variations in the reported data
		- added new argument 'interactive.display' for functions that generate interactive figures, eg. live.map(), totals.plt(), plt.SIR.model(), itrends(); for turning on/off the display of the figure
		- fixed a few bugs in itrends: failing when not arguments or only one geo.locn, were specified
		- fixed data integrity functions not being exported


May 2020:  Several new features _ ver 1.1
		- added integrity and consistency check fns --integrity.check/consistency.check/data.checks--
		- added "geo.loc" argument for report.summary() fn
		- added a couple of additional arguments to allow for customization of live.map()
		- added new options and function to retrieve US specific TimeSeries datasets: "ts-confirmed-us" and "ts-deaths-us" & covid19.US.data()
		- added new option and function to retrieve "Toronto" data: "ts-Toronto" & covid19.Toronto.data()
		- added more protection to growth.rate() and confidence bands drawing, to avoid failing plots with missing or inconsistency data
		- added trend functions: single.trend(), mtrends() and itrends()


April 2020:  A couple of bugs fixed, affecting the growth.rate() and plot.SIR.model() fns; few more features added to report.summary() and totals.plt() _ ver 1.0.1


March 2020:  Includes data access, basic analysis and interactive plotting functions _ ver 1.0
